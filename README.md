## How to get started
### **IMPORTANT**: 
### Meet the base minimum requirements (MVP) first before any creativity is involved. Although here in order to retrieve data from a mock database we need to think of a topic and gather from some in construction of our data datasets. Wireframe a little and refresh on some of the concepts from the lecture beneficial in fulfilling the the requirements. In addition test constantly using Thunder-Client, console log out errors to check, and commit early and frequently.
